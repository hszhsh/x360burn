We need to set a custom layer break when burning xbox 360 games, and this is the only thing what x360burn does for now.

This utility is a very basic GUI. You can use Apple DiscRecording Framework as well as growisofs to burn you disk images.

Anyone who is interested in this project is welcomed to join in. We can add more features together. Finally we can write a software like ImgBurn on windows.

The first release is based on Mac OS X 10.6 and 64-bit inte. Universal versions will be released later.
